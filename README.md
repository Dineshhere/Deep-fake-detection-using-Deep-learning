# Deep-fake-detection-using-Deep-learning
using deep learning models detecting the fake videos that are releasing in the real time world .

Introduction:

         Deepfakes are fake media in which a person's likeness is used to replace their original appearance in a picture or video. Deepfakes use potent machine learning 
and artificial intelligence techniques to edit or synthesize visual and audio information that can more readily fool, even though the act of producing fake content 
is not new. The most common deep learning-based machine learning techniques for producing deep fakes involve training generative neural network designs like autoencoders.

problem statement:

         To perform detection on whether the input data is real or fake using deep learning techniques.

solution:

         Our Deep learning model reads image or video then classifies it as real or deepfake generated fake data. Our Model is trained by feeding input through CNN 
which extracts the relevant features and we will be training another classifier model to classify whether the data is fake generated by deepfake or real.

conclusion:
         As viewing them no longer equates to believing in them, deepfakes have started to weaken people's 
faith in media material. They may distress individuals who are the target, exacerbate hate speech 
and disinformation, and even heighten political unrest, incite public unrest, violence, or even war.
This project includes a current review of deepfake detecting techniques. The artificial intelligence 
research community will benefit from this project in order to create efficient strategies for combating 
deepfakes.
